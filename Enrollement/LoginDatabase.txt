We are going to connect
our Database named "EnrollmentSystem.db"
to our program.

We are going to copy the File path of the Database, then we need to write "\name of your database don't forget to put the extension of the file ".db" because it will not work
Now we are now try to test the connection
The database is already connected.

Then we are now going to proceed to our code
